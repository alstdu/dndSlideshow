This is an assignment for the Web Scripting 1 Course at BCIT. The task was to make a slideshow you can control with first, next, previous, and last buttons
as well as the ability to click the thumbnails at the bottom of the page

I'd like to be clear that the images are taken from the D&D website, and do not belong to me. This was created for educational purposes only.
